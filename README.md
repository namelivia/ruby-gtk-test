# Ruby GTK Test

Just a test for creating a GTK user interface for a Ruby application, hopefully decoupling the code and ending up with a decent
architecture. This is just for experimenting pruposes, it may be abandoned or deleted in the future.

Thanks to [this amazing tutorial by iridakos](https://iridakos.com/tutorials/2018/01/25/creating-a-gtk-todo-application-with-ruby.html) because I've been mostly following his tutorials.

To compile Gtk resources execute `./compile_resources` to execute the application run `./ruby-gtk-test`.
