</p>

This is just a small test application that performs HTTP/HTTPS requests. It has a GTK use interface. The prupose of this application was to experiment designing and programming GTK interfaces for Ruby applications, just for experimenting pruposes, as a real application is incomplete and could be abandoned or deleted in the future.

To compile Gtk resources execute `./compile_resources` to execute the application run `./ruby-gtk-test`.
